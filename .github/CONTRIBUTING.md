## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- ✅ Code passes all checks (`pnpm type-check && pnpm check`)
- ✅ Changes build successfully (`pnpm build`)

### PR Guidelines

1. **Clear conventional title**: Describe what changed (e.g., `feat: add downloadAsset tool`)
2. **Description**: Explain what and why
3. **Link issues**: Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")

> Use common sense when drafting your pull request. The goal is to make it easy for maintainers to review and merge your changes. Include sufficient details but at the same time avoid unnecessary information.

### Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to automate changelog and release PRs. Please use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for all commit messages:

- `feat:` for new features (triggers a new release and changelog entry)
- `fix:` for bug fixes (triggers a new release and changelog entry)
- `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc. for other changes (do not trigger a release)

**Examples:**

- `feat: add downloadAsset tool`
- `fix: handle missing contentType in upload`
- `chore: update dependencies`

Only `feat:` and `fix:` commits will appear in the changelog and trigger a new release. All other commit types are allowed but will not trigger a release.
